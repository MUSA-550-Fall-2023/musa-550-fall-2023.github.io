It does a great job laying out the common issues associated with file paths and Python.\nA common challenge in collaborative data science work is dealing with file paths. A csv on your computer has a different file path than a csv on your colleague’s computer, and if you don’t plan ahead for that, your colleague won’t be able run your code on their computer without making (possibly many) changes.\nThis post contains a suggestion for how to organize your files and a glossary of terms. I’ll update it as things come up. Please let us know any questions!"

    "text": "Absolute v. relative file paths\nProblem: I write pd.read_csv(\"C:/Users/eugene/data.csv\") in my code and send it to a project partner, Gritty. Gritty tries to run it, but it fails, and they have to change the code to pd.read_csv(\"C:/Users/gritty/data.csv\") to make it work. These are known as absolute file paths, which point to the exact location of a file on a computer, and generally they make it difficult to share code.\nOne way to deal with this is to organize your projects (e.g., a homework assignment) into self-contained folders. Something like the below:\nC:\n|__ /Users\n    |__ /eugene\n        |__ /MUSA550\n            |__ /Homework1\n                 |__ homework1_notebook.ipynb\n                 |__ /Data\n                      |__ data.csv\nWith this, I could instead write pd.read_csv(\"Data/data.csv\"). Then, I could send Gritty my entire Homework1 folder or upload that folder to GitHub as a repository, and Gritty can run the notebook without making any changes. These are relative file paths, which point to the location of a file on a computer relative to the working directory (i.e., the folder where homework1_notebook.ipynb is saved).\nFor your homework assignments, the most straightforward way to structure your files is to download the entire GitHub repository for that assignment (see below). Then, you can create a Jupyter notebook in that folder and, when you’re finished, upload it to GitHub. This way, when we download the repository for grading, or you open the notebook on a different computer, everything will run without changes (assuming you used relative file paths)."

    "text": "Common Problems\nBelow we list some of the most common issues encountered when installing packages with mamba.\n\nMissing package errors\nIf you have successfully followed the steps outlined in the installation guide to create your environment, but receive an ImportError when importing packages, you might have launched the notebook from the 'base' environment instead of the ‘musa-550-fall-2023’ environment. Be sure to activate the ‘musa-550-fall-2023’ environment before launching the notebook.s\n\n\nThe file extension of the environment file on Windows\nBe sure that Windows does not automatically add an .txt extension to your environment.yml file. This will sometimes cause mamba to fail, with a cryptic error:\nSpecNotFound: environment with requirements.txt needs a name\nThe environment file needs to end in .yml. You can change the extension for a file on Windows following these instructions.\n\n\nMixing pip and mamba\nThe command pip can also be used to install Python packages. However, using pip to install packages into a mamba environment can lead to issues. It’s best to stick to using the mamba env update command to update your environment or mamba install package_name to install specific packages.\n\n\nImport errors for geopandas\nWhen importing geopandas, you can sometimes receive errors about missing libraries. This is usually because package versions got mixed up during installation. This can sometimes happen, and geopandas is particularly sensitive to the versions of its dependencies.\nThe best and easiest thing to do to try to solve it is use the steps above to create a fresh environment.\n\n\nNumpy errors\nIf you receive the following error:\nImportError: Something is wrong with the numpy installation. While importing we detected an older version of numpy in ['/path/to/old/version/of/numpy/'']. One method of fixing this is to repeatedly uninstall numpy until none is found, then reinstall this version.\nFrom the Miniforge Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), run:\nmamba install --force-reinstall --clobber numpy"

Most issues like this can be solved by simply deleting your current environment and starting fresh with a new version.\nThe following steps can be used to try to solve common issues:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe commands here should be executed via the command line, either using the Miniforge Prompt on Windows or the Terminal app on MacOS.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Delete any existing environment\nWe want to create a fresh environment, so you can delete any environment that was giving you issues. If that environment was called ‘musa-550-fall-2023’, you can run the following commands to delete it:\nmamba deactivate\nmamba env remove --name musa-550-fall-2023\nThe first command will make sure the environment we are deleting isn’t active, and then the second command will perform the deletion.\n\n\nStep 2: Create a fresh environment\nFollow the instructions outlined here to create a fresh version of the course website."

The dashboard should like look something like this:\n\nOn the left, you’ll see a file browser for the files in the folder where you ran the jupyter lab command. On the right you will see the “Launcher”, which allows you to easily create various types of new files. Click on the “Python 3” button under the “Notebook” section and you’ll create your first notebook. Alternatively, you can use the File -&gt; New -&gt; Notebook option from the menu bar. The new notebook, entitled “Untitled.ipynb”, is created within the same directory.\nThe “Launcher” also shows you what other actions you can take with JupyterLab, including creating text files, Python files (“.py” files), Markdown files, new terminals or Python consoles. One of the most powerful features of JupyterLab is its ability to handle multiple file formats at once. You can have multiple file types open in the main work area and drag and resize these files to view them all at once, as described here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nMore info on the various components of the JupyterLab interface, with several useful videos, is available here."

It does not need to be interesting or insightful, but it is good practice to always note the main conclusions so the notebook make sense after time passes.\nExtra credit:: 2-chart altair dashboard,\n\nThis should be in addition to the 3 charts above\nFiltering on one chart should cross-filter the other chart (via transform_filter())\n\n\nNote: You may include geospatial charts to satisfy the above requirements, but you are not required to."

If we execute it, it should print out “Hello, World” to the command line.\nFirst, let’s open up the .py file in the JupyterLab text editor. Double click on the “hello_world.py” item in the file browser on the left:\n\nThis will open the file and allow you to make edits. You should see the following:\n# Our first Python program\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSee the JupyterLab docs for more info on the text editor.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the JupyterLab Terminal\nTo execute the file, we can use the built-in Terminal feature in JupyterLab using the following steps:\n\nBring up the “Launcher” tab by clicking on the blue button with a plus sign in the upper left.\nClick on the “Terminal” button”\nWhen the terminal opens, type the following:\n\npython hello_world.py\nAnd you should see the following output:\nHello World!\nIt should look something like this:"

It will unpack the dictionary and pass each keyword to the function.\nSo the previous code is the same as:\nsns.scatterplot(\n    x=\"flipper_length_mm\", \n    y=\"bill_length_mm\", \n    hue=\"species\",\n    data=penguins, \n    ax=ax, \n    palette=color_map, # defined in the style dict \n    edgecolor=\"none\", # defined in the style dict\n    alpha=0.5 # defined in the style dict\n)\nBut we can use **style as a shortcut!\n\n\n\nAn aside: the seaborn objects interface\nSeaborn recently introduced an “objects” interface, a completely new syntax that aims to be more declarative. It hides the interaction with matplotlib for the user and provides an more intuitive way to customize charts.\nYou’ll see a lot of similarities between the “objects” interface and the next library we will talk about: altair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSince it’s so new and not yet finalized, we won’t recommend using it during this course. However, we wanted to make sure you’re aware of it as it could be a good option in the future. More info can be found on seaborn’s documentation.\n\n\nAs a reference, our scatterplot example would look like this in the “objects” interface:\n\nimport seaborn.objects as so\n\n\n(\n    so.Plot(x=\"flipper_length_mm\", y=\"bill_length_mm\", color=\"species\", data=penguins)\n    .add(so.Dot())\n    .scale(color=color_map)\n    .layout(size=(10, 6))\n    .label(x=\"Flipper Length (mm)\", y=\"Bill Length (mm)\")\n    # Warning: this theme syntax is not yet finalized!\n    .theme({\"axes.facecolor\": \"w\", \"axes.edgecolor\": \"k\"})\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany more functions available\nIn general, seaborn is fantastic for visualizing relationships between variables in a more quantitative way\nDon’t memorize every function…\nI always look at the beautiful Example Gallery for ideas.\n\nHow about adding linear regression lines?\nUse lmplot()\n\nsns.lmplot(\n    x=\"flipper_length_mm\",\n    y=\"bill_length_mm\",\n    hue=\"species\",\n    data=penguins,\n    height=6,\n    aspect=1.5,\n    palette=color_map,\n    scatter_kws=dict(edgecolor=\"none\", alpha=0.5),\n);\n\n/Users/nhand/mambaforge/envs/musa-550-fall-2023/lib/python3.10/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py:118: UserWarning: The figure layout has changed to tight\n  self._figure.tight_layout(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about the smoothed 2D distribution?\nUse jointplot()\n\nsns.jointplot(\n    x=\"flipper_length_mm\",\n    y=\"bill_length_mm\",\n    data=penguins,\n    height=8,\n    kind=\"kde\",\n    cmap=\"viridis\",\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about comparing more than two variables at once?\nUse pairplot()\n\n# The variables to plot\nvariables = [\n    \"species\",\n    \"bill_length_mm\",\n    \"flipper_length_mm\",\n    \"body_mass_g\",\n    \"bill_depth_mm\",\n]\n\n# Set the seaborn style\nsns.set_context(\"notebook\", font_scale=1.5)\n\n# make the pair plot\nsns.pairplot(\n    penguins[variables].dropna(),\n    palette=color_map,\n    hue=\"species\",\n    plot_kws=dict(alpha=0.5, edgecolor=\"none\"),\n)\n\n/Users/nhand/mambaforge/envs/musa-550-fall-2023/lib/python3.10/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py:118: UserWarning: The figure layout has changed to tight\n  self._figure.tight_layout(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s explore the bill length differences across species and gender\nWe can use seaborn’s functionality for exploring categorical data sets: catplot()\n\nsns.catplot(x=\"species\", y=\"bill_length_mm\", hue=\"sex\", data=penguins);\n\n/Users/nhand/mambaforge/envs/musa-550-fall-2023/lib/python3.10/site-packages/seaborn/axisgrid.py:118: UserWarning: The figure layout has changed to tight\n  self._figure.tight_layout(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeaborn tutorials broken down by data type\n\nTutorial landing page\n\nVisualizing statistical relationships\nCategorical data\nVisualizing the distribution of a data set\nVisualizing linear relationships\n\n\n\n\nColor palettes in seaborn\nGreat tutorial available in the seaborn documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe color_palette() function in seaborn is very useful.

That means that if you pass a DataFrame to your chart with a lot of data, your browser might be overwhelmed and everything might freeze. To avoid this, altair will throw an error if your DataFrame has more than 5,000 rows.\nThere are a number of strategies outlined on the docs for dealing with larger datasets. One is to simply disable the max rows check — this could be a good idea if your dataset is just a bit larger than the limit.\nalt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()\nAnother strategy is to use the more flexible “vegafusion” library, which has improved implementations of data transformations and allows charts with data up to 100,000 rows. You can enable this transformer with:\nalt.data_transformers.enable(\"vegafusion\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you get an error about missing packages, make sure you update your course environment to the latest version. See the instructions here.\n\n\n\n\nUsually, the function calls are chained together\nSurround your code with parentheses, and put each line of code on a new line\n\nchart = (\n    alt.Chart(penguins)\n    .mark_circle(size=60)\n    .encode(\n        x=alt.X(\"flipper_length_mm\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),\n        y=alt.Y(\"bill_length_mm\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),\n        color=\"species:N\",\n    )\n    .interactive()\n)\n\nchart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the interactive() call allows users to pan and zoom.\nAltair is able to automatically determine the type of the variable using built-in heuristics. Altair and Vega-Lite support four primitive data types:\n\n\n\n\nData Type\n\n\nCode\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nquantitative\n\n\nQ\n\n\nNumerical quantity (real-valued)\n\n\n\n\nnominal\n\n\nN\n\n\nName / Unordered categorical\n\n\n\n\nordinal\n\n\nO\n\n\nOrdered categorial\n\n\n\n\ntemporal\n\n\nT\n\n\nDate/time\n\n\n\n\nYou can set the data type of a column explicitly using a one letter code attached to the column name with a colon:\n\n\nFaceting\nEasily create multiple views of a dataset with faceting\n\n(\n    alt.Chart(penguins)\n    .mark_point()\n    .encode(\n        x=alt.X(\"flipper_length_mm:Q\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),\n        y=alt.Y(\"bill_length_mm:Q\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),\n        color=\"species:N\",\n    )\n    .properties(width=200, height=200)\n    .facet(column=\"species\")\n    .interactive()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: I’ve added the variable type identifiers (Q, N) to the previous example\nLots of features to create compound charts: repeated charts, faceted charts, vertical and horizontal stacking of subplots.\nSee the documentation for examples\n\n\nA grammar of interaction\nA relatively new addition to altair, vega, and vega-lite. This allows you to define what happens when users interact with your visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI highly recommend reading through the documentation section on interactive charts. Altair’s interaction language is very complex and you can do a lot, including adding widgets (e.g., sliders) and multiple kinds of selection windows.\n\n\n\n\nA faceted plot, now with interaction!\n\n# Create the selection box\nbrush = alt.selection_interval()\n\n\n(\n    alt.Chart(penguins)  # Create the chart\n    .mark_point()  # Use point markers\n    .encode(  # Encode\n        x=alt.X(\"flipper_length_mm\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),  # X\n        y=alt.Y(\"bill_length_mm\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),  # Y\n        # Use a conditional color based on brush\n        color=alt.condition(brush, \"species\", alt.value(\"lightgray\")),  # Color\n        tooltip=[\"species\", \"flipper_length_mm\", \"bill_length_mm\"],  # Tooltip\n    )\n    .add_params(brush)  # Add brush parameter\n    .properties(width=200, height=200)  # Set width/height\n    .facet(column=\"species\") # Facet\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on conditions\nWe used the alt.condition() function to specify a conditional color for the markers. It takes three arguments:\n\nThe brush object determines if a data point is currently selected\nIf inside the brush, color the marker according to the “species” column\nIf outside the brush, use the literal hex color “lightgray”\n\n\n\nSelecting across multiple variables\nLet’s examine the relationship between flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm, and body_mass_g\nWe’ll use a repeated chart that repeats variables across rows and columns.\nUse a conditional color again, based on a brush selection.\n\n# Setup the selection brush\nbrush = alt.selection(type=\"interval\", resolve=\"global\")\n\n# Setup the chart\n(\n    alt.Chart(penguins)\n    .mark_circle()\n    .encode(\n        x=alt.X(alt.repeat(\"column\"), type=\"quantitative\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),\n        y=alt.Y(alt.repeat(\"row\"), type=\"quantitative\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),\n        color=alt.condition(\n            brush, \"species:N\", alt.value(\"lightgray\")\n        ),  # conditional color\n    )\n    .properties(\n        width=200,\n        height=200,\n    )\n    .add_params(brush)\n    .repeat(  # repeat variables across rows and columns\n        row=[\"flipper_length_mm\", \"bill_length_mm\", \"body_mass_g\"],\n        column=[\"body_mass_g\", \"bill_length_mm\", \"flipper_length_mm\"],\n    )\n)\n\n/Users/nhand/mambaforge/envs/musa-550-fall-2023/lib/python3.10/site-packages/altair/utils/deprecation.py:65: AltairDeprecationWarning: 'selection' is deprecated.\n   Use 'selection_point()' or 'selection_interval()' instead; these functions also include more helpful docstrings.\n  warnings.warn(message, AltairDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore exploratory visualization\nLet’s try out some more features of Altair…these examples are meant as reference for you to showcase some common features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminder\n\n\n\nThe Example Gallery is a great place to learn the full functionality of Altair and includes a lot of great examples!\n\n\n\nExample 1: Color schemes\n\nScatter flipper length vs body mass for each species, colored by sex\n\n\n(\n    alt.Chart(penguins)\n    .mark_point()\n    .encode(\n        x=alt.X(\"flipper_length_mm\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),\n        y=alt.Y(\"body_mass_g\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),\n        color=alt.Color(\"sex:N\", scale=alt.Scale(scheme=\"set2\")),\n    )\n    .properties(width=400, height=150)\n    .facet(row=\"species\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI’ve specified the scale keyword to the alt.Color() object and passed a scheme value:\nscale=alt.Scale(scheme=\"set2\")\n\nThe scheme “set2” is a Color Brewer color. The available color schemes are very similar to those matplotlib. A list is available on the Vega documentation: https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/.\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Histogram aggregations with count\n\nNext, plot the total number of penguins per species by the island they are found on.\n\n\n(\n    alt.Chart(penguins)\n    .mark_bar()\n    .encode(\n        # X should show the (normalized) count of each group\n        x=alt.X(\"*:Q\", aggregate=\"count\", stack=\"normalize\"), # The * is a placeholder here\n        y=\"island:N\",\n        color=\"species:N\",\n        tooltip=[\"island\", \"species\", \"count(*):Q\"],\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI like to think of altair aggregations in terms of the pandas groupby syntax. Under the hood, altair is going to group our data by the other encodings we specified, “island” and “species”. The dimension (“X”) that gets specified as the count aggregation is then the size of each of those groups.\n\n\n\n\nExample 3: The count() shorthand\n\nPlot a histogram of number of penguins by flipper length, grouped by species.\n\n\n(\n    alt.Chart(penguins)\n    .mark_bar()\n    .encode(\n        x=alt.X(\"flipper_length_mm\", bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=20)),\n        y=\"count():Q\",  # Shorthand\n        color=\"species\",\n        tooltip=[\"species\", alt.Tooltip(\"count()\", title=\"Number of Penguins\")],\n    )\n    .properties(height=250)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4: Binning data and using the mean aggregation\n\nFinally, let’s bin the data by body mass and plot the average flipper length per bin, colored by the species.\n\nIn this example, we use a “binning” transformation to bin the data along a certain encoding (“X” in this case), and then we will take the mean along the “Y” encoding.\n\n(\n    alt.Chart(penguins.dropna())\n    .mark_line()\n    .encode(\n        x=alt.X(\"body_mass_g:Q\", bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=10)), # Bin the data!\n        y=alt.Y(\n            \"mean(flipper_length_mm):Q\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False) # Mean of flipper length\n        ),  \n        color=\"species:N\",\n        tooltip=[\"mean(flipper_length_mm):Q\", \"count():Q\"],\n    )\n    .properties(height=300, width=500)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn addition to mean() and count(), you can apply a number of different transformations to the data before plotting, including binning, arbitrary functions, and filters.\nSee the Data Transformations section of the user guide for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\nDashboards become easy to make…\n\n# Setup a brush selection\nbrush = alt.selection(type=\"interval\")\n\n# The top scatterplot: flipper length vs bill length\npoints = (\n    alt.Chart()\n    .mark_point()\n    .encode(\n        x=alt.X(\"flipper_length_mm:Q\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),\n        y=alt.Y(\"bill_length_mm:Q\", scale=alt.Scale(zero=False)),\n        color=alt.condition(brush, \"species:N\", alt.value(\"lightgray\")),\n    )\n    .properties(width=800)\n    .add_params(brush)\n)\n\n# The bottom bar plot\nbars = (\n    alt.Chart()\n    .mark_bar()\n    .encode(\n        x=\"count(species):Q\",\n        y=\"species:N\",\n        color=\"species:N\",\n    )\n    .transform_filter(\n        brush  # the filter transform uses the selection to filter the input data to this chart\n    )\n    .properties(width=800)\n)\n\n# Final chart is a vertical stack\nchart = alt.vconcat(points, bars, data=penguins)\n\n# Output the chart\nchart"

A shapefile\nActually several files with the same common prefix.\nMandatory files:\n\n.shp: the file containing the geometries\n.shx: the file that indexes the geometry\n.dbf: tabular data format storing the attributes for each geometry\n\nAnd many optional files for documentation, projection information, etc.\nLet’s take a look at an example shapefile:\nWe’ll use the %ls command to list out all of the files in an example shapefile in the data/ folder\n\n%ls \"data/ne_110m_admin_0_countries/\"\n\nne_110m_admin_0_countries.cpg  ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp\nne_110m_admin_0_countries.dbf  ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shx\nne_110m_admin_0_countries.prj\n\n\n\n\n2.

We have a “datetime64[ns]” dtype for our new column now.\nNow that the column is a Datetime Series, it has a special “.dt” attribute. This attribute allows you to quickly extract out parts of the date, e.g., month, day, year, etc., as new columns.\nFor all of the possible options, see the API docs for pd.Series — take a look at all of the entries that start with pd.Series.dt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: The strftime() function\n\n\n\nFor converting datetime objects to strings in a certain format, we can use the “strftime” function (docs). This uses a special syntax to convert the date object to a string with a specific format.\nHelpful reference: Use this strftime guide to look up the syntax!\n\n\n\n# Use the .dt attribute to extract out the month integer (starting at 0)\ntrash_requests_gdf[\"month_int\"] = trash_requests_gdf[\"requested_datetime_dt\"].dt.month\n\n# Get the month name too — this is what %B means - (use strftime.org to see the codes!)\ntrash_requests_gdf[\"month\"] = trash_requests_gdf[\"requested_datetime_dt\"].dt.strftime(\n    \"%B\"\n)\n\n\ntrash_requests_gdf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nobjectid\nservice_request_id\nstatus\nstatus_notes\nservice_name\nservice_code\nagency_responsible\nservice_notice\nrequested_datetime\nupdated_datetime\nexpected_datetime\naddress\nzipcode\nmedia_url\nlat\nlon\ngeometry\nrequested_datetime_dt\nmonth_int\nmonth\n\n\n\n\n0\n8180042\n13269656\nClosed\nNaN\nRubbish/Recyclable Material Collection\nSR-ST03\nStreets Department\n2 Business Days\n2020-04-02 19:22:24\n2020-04-06 07:02:57\n2020-04-06 20:00:00\n624 FOULKROD ST\nNaN\nNaN\n40.034389\n-75.106518\nPOINT (-75.10652 40.03439)\n2020-04-02 19:22:24\n4\nApril\n\n\n1\n8180043\n13266979\nClosed\nNaN\nRubbish/Recyclable Material Collection\nSR-ST03\nStreets Department\n2 Business Days\n2020-04-02 08:40:53\n2020-04-06 07:02:58\n2020-04-05 20:00:00\n1203 ELLSWORTH ST\nNaN\nNaN\n39.936164\n-75.163497\nPOINT (-75.16350 39.93616)\n2020-04-02 08:40:53\n4\nApril\n\n\n2\n7744426\n13066443\nClosed\nNaN\nRubbish/Recyclable Material Collection\nSR-ST03\nStreets Department\n2 Business Days\n2020-01-02 19:17:55\n2020-01-04 05:46:06\n2020-01-06 19:00:00\n9054 WESLEYAN RD\nNaN\nNaN\n40.058737\n-75.018345\nPOINT (-75.01835 40.05874)\n2020-01-02 19:17:55\n1\nJanuary\n\n\n3\n7744427\n13066540\nClosed\nNaN\nRubbish/Recyclable Material Collection\nSR-ST03\nStreets Department\n2 Business Days\n2020-01-03 07:01:46\n2020-01-04 05:46:07\n2020-01-06 19:00:00\n2784 WILLITS RD\nNaN\nNaN\n40.063658\n-75.022347\nPOINT (-75.02235 40.06366)\n2020-01-03 07:01:46\n1\nJanuary\n\n\n4\n7801094\n13089345\nClosed\nNaN\nRubbish/Recyclable Material Collection\nSR-ST03\nStreets Department\n2 Business Days\n2020-01-15 13:22:14\n2020-01-16 14:03:29\n2020-01-16 19:00:00\n6137 LOCUST ST\nNaN\nNaN\n39.958186\n-75.244732\nPOINT (-75.24473 39.95819)\n2020-01-15 13:22:14\n1\nJanuary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s group by the month integer and month name, and get the size of the groups using the built-in .size() function of the groupby object:\n\ntotals_by_month = trash_requests_gdf.groupby(\n    by=[\"month_int\", \"month\"], as_index=False\n).size()\n\ntotals_by_month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmonth_int\nmonth\nsize\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nJanuary\n2710\n\n\n1\n2\nFebruary\n2067\n\n\n2\n3\nMarch\n2460\n\n\n3\n4\nApril\n5778\n\n\n4\n5\nMay\n6572\n\n\n5\n6\nJune\n6485\n\n\n6\n7\nJuly\n9627\n\n\n7\n8\nAugust\n4466\n\n\n8\n9\nSeptember\n1704\n\n\n9\n10\nOctober\n1335\n\n\n10\n11\nNovember\n1729\n\n\n11\n12\nDecember\n2757\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI’ve used the as_index=False keyword to the groupby() function. This will force the size() function to return a DataFrame instead of having the month column as the index of the resulted groupby operation.\nRemember, the columns you group by become the index of the aggregated DataFrame. I often like to have them as columns in the DataFrame instead — the as_index=False flag exists for exactly this problem.\n\n\n\n\nPlot a bar chart with seaborn\nFor making static bar charts with Python, seaborn’s sns.barplot() is usually the best option!\n\n# Initialize figure/axes\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))\n\n# Plot!\nsns.barplot(\n    x=\"month_int\",\n    y=\"size\",\n    data=totals_by_month,\n    color=\"#2176d2\",\n    ax=ax,\n)\n\nax.set_xticklabels(totals_by_month[\"month\"]);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Let’s improve the aesthetics via matplotlib\nThe trend is clear in the previous chart, but can we do a better job with the aesthetics? Yes!\nFor reference, here is a common way to clean up charts in matplotlib:\n\n# Initialize figure/axes\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))\n\n# Plot!\nsns.barplot(\n    x=\"month\",\n    y=\"size\",\n    data=totals_by_month,\n    color=\"#2176d2\",\n    ax=ax,\n    order=[\n        \"January\",\n        \"February\",\n        \"March\",\n        \"April\",\n        \"May\",\n        \"June\",\n        \"July\",\n        \"August\",\n        \"September\",\n        \"October\",\n        \"November\",\n        \"December\",\n    ],\n    zorder=999,  # Make sure the bar charts are on top of the grid\n)\n\n# Remove x/y axis labels\nax.set_xlabel(\"\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"\")\n\n# Set the yticks to go from 0 to 10,000 with 2,000 step\nax.set_yticks(np.arange(0, 1e4 + 1, 2e3))\n\n# Format the ytick labels to use a comma and no decimal places\nax.set_yticklabels([f\"{yval:,.0f}\" for yval in ax.get_yticks()])\n\n# Rotate the xticks\nplt.setp(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=60)\n\n# Add a grid backgrou d\nax.grid(True, axis=\"y\")\n\n# Remove the top and right axes lines\nax.spines[\"top\"].set_visible(False)\nax.spines[\"right\"].set_visible(False)\n\n# Add a title\nax.set_title(\n    \"Philadelphia's Trash-Related 311 Requests in 2020\", weight=\"bold\", fontsize=16\n);\n\n\n\n\nTakeaway: A huge spike in trash related tickets over the summer in 2020!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis example could come in handy for reference as you work on assignment 2, where you will need to create polished and clear visualizations using both matplotlib and seaborn."

    "text": "Part 1: More interactive data viz\n\nRecap: The Python data viz landscape\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat have we learned so far\n\nMatplotlib\n\nThe classic, most flexible library\nCan handle geographic data well\nOverly verbose syntax, syntax is not declarative\n\n\n\nPandas\n\nQuick, built-in interface\nNot as many features as other libraries\n\n\n\nSeaborn\n\nBest for visualizing complex relationships between variables\nImproves matplotlib’s syntax: more declarative\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nEasy, declarative syntax\nLots of interactive features\nComplex visualizations with minimal amounts of code\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll learn one more today…\n\n\n\n\n\nHoloViz: A set of coordinated visualization libraries in Python\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe motivation behind HoloViz mirrors the goals of this course\nProper data visualization is crucial throughout all of the steps of the data science pipeline: data wrangling, modeling, and storytelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday: hvPlot, Holoviews, Geoviews\n\n\nLater in the course: Datashader, Param, Panel\n\n\nHoloViz: A quick overview\n\nBokeh: creating interactive visualizations using Javascript using Python\nHoloViews: a declarative, high-level library for creating bokeh visualizations\n\nNote: The relationship between Bokeh and Holoviews is similar to Altair and Vega\n\nA significant pro\nGeoViews builds on HoloViews to add support for geographic data\n\n\nThe major cons\n\nAll are relatively new\nBokeh is the most well-tested\nHoloViews, GeoViews, hvPlot are being actively developed but are very promising\n\n\n\n\nHow does hvPlot fit in?\nHigh-level visualization library designed to help you quickly create interactive charts during your data wrangling\nMain uses: - Quickly generate interactive plots from your data - Seamlessly handles pandas and geopandas data - Relies on Holoviews and Geoviews under the hood\nIt provides an interface just like the pandas plot() function, but much more useful.\n\n\nExample: let’s return to the measles dataset\n\n# Our usual imports\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\n\n# Let's load the measles data from week 2\n\nurl =

Holoviews Curve object.\nNot unlike altair Chart objects, it’s an object that knows how to translate from your DataFrame data to a visualization.\n\nprint(img)\n\n:Curve   [YEAR]   (incidence)\n\n\n\n\nMany different chart types are available…\n\nby_year.hvplot(x=\"YEAR\", y=\"incidence\", kind=\"scatter\")\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nby_year.hvplot(x='YEAR', y='incidence', kind=\"bar\", rot=90, width=1000)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like in altair, we can also layer chart elements together\nUse the * operator to layer together chart elements.\nNote: the same thing can be accomplished in altair, but with the + operator.\n\n# The line chart of incidence vs year\nincidence = by_year.hvplot(x='YEAR', y='incidence', kind=\"line\")\n\n# Vertical line + label for vaccine year\nvline = hv.VLine(1963).opts(color=\"black\")\nlabel = hv.Text(1963, 27000, \" Vaccine introduced\", halign=\"left\")\n\nfinal_chart = incidence * vline * label\nfinal_chart\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can group charts by a specific column, with automatic widget selectors\nThis is some powerful magic.\nLet’s calculate the annual measles incidence for each year and state:\n\nby_state = measles_data.groupby([\"YEAR\", \"state\"], as_index=False)[\"incidence\"].sum()\n\nby_state.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYEAR\nstate\nincidence\n\n\n\n\n0\n1928\nALABAMA\n334.99\n\n\n1\n1928\nALASKA\n0.00\n\n\n2\n1928\nARIZONA\n200.75\n\n\n3\n1928\nARKANSAS\n481.77\n\n\n4\n1928\nCALIFORNIA\n69.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, tell hvplot to plot produce a chart of incidence over time for each state:\n\nby_state_chart = by_state.hvplot(\n    x=\"YEAR\", y=\"incidence\", groupby=\"state\", width=400, kind=\"line\"\n)\n\nby_state_chart\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can select out individual charts from the set of grouped objects\nUse the dict-like selection syntax: [key]\n\nPA = by_state_chart[\"PENNSYLVANIA\"].relabel(\"PA\") # .relabel() is optional — it just changes the title\nNJ = by_state_chart[\"NEW JERSEY\"].relabel(\"NJ\")\n\n\n\nCombine charts as subplots with the +

This service is hosted in the cloud, meaning that the code is not being executed locally on your laptop but instead on Binder’s servers. This can be very convenient, since it doesn’t require you to have the files downloaded to your laptop or your Python environment to be set up yet. On the content page for each week, look for the Binder logo  for links to launch the lectures on Binder.\nOn the content page for each week, there are also links to HTML versions of the lecture slides. Look for the  icon for this version of the slides. Since they are displayed in the browser, they are NOT executable and cannot be changed. This version of the slides is a useful reference tool to look up how we did something in class. During class periods, we recommend that you use options #1 or #2 to view the slides, so that you can follow along and execute slides and participate in any in-class exercises or labs."

    "section": "Basic pandas concepts",
    "text": "Basic pandas concepts\nThe primary objects in pandas are the:\n\nDataFrame, which is very similar to an Excel spreadsheet, and has rows and named columns\nSeries, which represents a single column of data. A DataFrame contains one or more Series and a name for each Series.\n\nThe data frame is a commonly used abstraction for data manipulation. Similar implementations exist in R.\nYou can think Series objects as fancier versions of Python’s built-in list data type.\nTo create a Series object, pass a list of values to the pd.Series() function:\n\n## Philadelphia metro counties and populations\n\ncounty_names = pd.Series(\n    [\n        \"Bucks\",\n        \"Chester\",\n        \"Delaware\",\n        \"Montgomery\",\n        \"Philadelphia\",\n        \"Burlington\",\n        \"Camden\",\n        \"Gloucester\",\n    ]\n)\n\npopulation = pd.Series(\n    [\n        645054.0,\n        545823.0,\n        575182.0,\n        864683.0,\n        1567258.0,\n        466103.0,\n        524907.0,\n        306601.0,\n    ]\n)\n\nDataFrame objects can be created by passing a dict mapping string column names to their respective Series.\n\ncounty_df = pd.DataFrame({\"County Name\": county_names, \"Population\": population})\n\ncounty_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\n\n\n\n\n0\nBucks\n645054.0\n\n\n1\nChester\n545823.0\n\n\n2\nDelaware\n575182.0\n\n\n3\nMontgomery\n864683.0\n\n\n4\nPhiladelphia\n1567258.0\n\n\n5\nBurlington\n466103.0\n\n\n6\nCamden\n524907.0\n\n\n7\nGloucester\n306601.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAlways try to give your variables meaningful names. It will help immensely when you are trying to debug problems or when you’re trying to understand the code you’ve written months later.\n\n\n\n1. Accessing data\n\n# Access columns with a dict-like syntax\ncounty_df[\"Population\"]\n\n0     645054.0\n1     545823.0\n2     575182.0\n3     864683.0\n4    1567258.0\n5     466103.0\n6     524907.0\n7     306601.0\nName: Population, dtype: float64\n\n\nRows can be accessed using Python’s syntax for slicing:\n\n## Example: slicing a list slicing\n\n# Get the elements with indices 1 and 2 (but NOT 3)\ncounty_list = [\"Bucks\", \"Philadelphia\", \"Delaware\"]\n\ncounty_list[0:2]  # Same as county_list[:2] (omitting the zero)\n\n['Bucks', 'Philadelphia']\n\n\nUnfortunately the functionality for slicing lists is not that powerful…but pandas will have many more features!\n\n# Slicing a DataFrame is similar...but now we will get rows of the DataFrame back!\n\ncounty_df[0:2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\n\n\n\n\n0\nBucks\n645054.0\n\n\n1\nChester\n545823.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npandas includes functionality for many different ways of selecting data. See the documentation for many more examples.\n\n\n2. Manipulating data\n\ncounty_df[\"Population\"].median()\n\n560502.5\n\n\n\ncounty_df[\"Population\"].mean()\n\n686951.375\n\n\nNumPy (Numerical Python) is a popular toolkit for scientific computing. Among other things, it can calculate mathematical functions, like mean, median, min, max, etc.\npandas Series can be used as arguments to most NumPy functions:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n\n# Calculate the median population value\nnp.median(county_df[\"Population\"])\n\n560502.5\n\n\n\n# Calculate the median population value\nnp.mean(county_df[\"Population\"])\n\n686951.375\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: DataCamp + NumPy\n\n\n\nWe won’t go through the specifics of NumPy in detail in this course. You will see it pop up throughout the course, particularly when we start talking about two-dimensional raster image data. NumPy specializes in multi-dimensional arrays, the same format of multi-band raster data.\nIn the meantime, if you want to know more about NumPy or just build your Python knowledge, check out the DataCamp course on NumPy. To get free access to DataCamp, see the instructions on the course website.\n\n\n\n\n3. Applying a function\nFor more complex single-column transformations, you can use Series.apply. It accepts a function that is applied to each value in the Series.\nAn apply operation allows you to call an arbitrary function to each value in a column. It is a core pandas concept and can be very powerful for complex calculations.\nAs an example, we can find which counties have a population greater than one million:\n\n# Define our function\ndef get_large_counties(population):\n    return population &gt; 1e6\n\n\nlarge_county_sel = county_df[\"Population\"].apply(get_large_counties)\n\n\n# This is a Series where the value is the returned value from the above function\nlarge_county_sel\n\n0    False\n1    False\n2    False\n3    False\n4     True\n5    False\n6    False\n7    False\nName: Population, dtype: bool\n\n\n\n# Add the new computed column to our original data frame\ncounty_df[\"Large Counties\"] = large_county_sel\n\n\ncounty_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\nLarge Counties\n\n\n\n\n0\nBucks\n645054.0\nFalse\n\n\n1\nChester\n545823.0\nFalse\n\n\n2\nDelaware\n575182.0\nFalse\n\n\n3\nMontgomery\n864683.0\nFalse\n\n\n4\nPhiladelphia\n1567258.0\nTrue\n\n\n5\nBurlington\n466103.0\nFalse\n\n\n6\nCamden\n524907.0\nFalse\n\n\n7\nGloucester\n306601.0\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could have also used a Python lambda function for our function. These are inline functions that start with a special Python keyword lambda, followed by the function argument, a colon, and then the contents of the function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSee this DataCamp tutorial for more info on lambda functions.\n\n\nAs an example, let’s add a small counties column using a lambda function. The lambda function below is equivalent to the more verbose traditional definition:\n# Equivalent to -&gt; lambda population: population &lt; 1e6\ndef small_counties_func(population):\n    return population &lt; 1e6\n\nsmall_counties_func = lambda population: population &lt; 1e6\n\n# we can also use lambda (unnamed, inline) functions\ncounty_df[\"Small Counties\"] = county_df[\"Population\"].apply(small_counties_func)\n\n# Print out\ncounty_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\nLarge Counties\nSmall Counties\n\n\n\n\n0\nBucks\n645054.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n1\nChester\n545823.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\nDelaware\n575182.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\nMontgomery\n864683.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n4\nPhiladelphia\n1567258.0\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n5\nBurlington\n466103.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n6\nCamden\n524907.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n7\nGloucester\n306601.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Data selection\nWe can select the “large” counties by passing the boolean values to the .loc[] function of a DataFrame:\n\ncounty_df[\"Large Counties\"]\n\n0    False\n1    False\n2    False\n3    False\n4     True\n5    False\n6    False\n7    False\nName: Large Counties, dtype: bool\n\n\n\ncounty_df.loc[ county_df[\"Large Counties\"] ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\nLarge Counties\nSmall Counties\n\n\n\n\n4\nPhiladelphia\n1567258.0\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBe sure to use square brackets when calling .loc.\n.loc[] ✓\n.loc() ✘\n\n\nBut: there is a faster, more concise, to achieve this!\n\ncounty_df[\"Population\"] &gt; 1e6\n\n0    False\n1    False\n2    False\n3    False\n4     True\n5    False\n6    False\n7    False\nName: Population, dtype: bool\n\n\n\n# We can pass the selection directory the .loc[] —&gt; no need to define a new variable\n\ncounty_df.loc[ county_df[\"Population\"] &gt; 1e6 ] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\nLarge Counties\nSmall Counties\n\n\n\n\n4\nPhiladelphia\n1567258.0\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What about getting rows where “Large Counties” is False?\nAnswer: Use the Python tilde operator to do a logicial not operation:\n\n# Reverse the large counties boolean selection\ncounty_df.loc[ ~large_county_sel ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\nLarge Counties\nSmall Counties\n\n\n\n\n0\nBucks\n645054.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n1\nChester\n545823.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\nDelaware\n575182.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\nMontgomery\n864683.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n5\nBurlington\n466103.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n6\nCamden\n524907.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n7\nGloucester\n306601.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# or equivalently:\n# NOTE: you need to put the whole expression in () and then apply the tilde!\n\ncounty_df.loc[ ~(county_df[\"Population\"] &gt; 1e6) ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\nLarge Counties\nSmall Counties\n\n\n\n\n0\nBucks\n645054.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n1\nChester\n545823.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\nDelaware\n575182.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\nMontgomery\n864683.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n5\nBurlington\n466103.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n6\nCamden\n524907.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n7\nGloucester\n306601.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAh! An even faster way!\nWe can use the pandas query function.\nThe query() function will return a subset of your dataframe based on a string version of the boolean expression.\n\ncounty_df.query(\"Population &lt; 1e6\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\nLarge Counties\nSmall Counties\n\n\n\n\n0\nBucks\n645054.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n1\nChester\n545823.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\nDelaware\n575182.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\nMontgomery\n864683.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n5\nBurlington\n466103.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n6\nCamden\n524907.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n7\nGloucester\n306601.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat else can .loc[] do? So much!\nOne of the more common uses is use the DataFrame’s index labels to select particular rows. What is the index?\nEach row has a label that idenitifes it. By default the label is an integer ranging from 0 (first row) to 1 less than the number of rows (last row). The label is displayed in bold before each row when you look at a DataFrame:\n\ncounty_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\nLarge Counties\nSmall Counties\n\n\n\n\n0\nBucks\n645054.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n1\nChester\n545823.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\nDelaware\n575182.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n3\nMontgomery\n864683.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n4\nPhiladelphia\n1567258.0\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n5\nBurlington\n466103.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n6\nCamden\n524907.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n7\nGloucester\n306601.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can pass a label to the .loc[] function to select a particular row. For example, to get the Philadelphia row, we could use the “4” label:\n\ncounty_df.loc[4]\n\nCounty Name       Philadelphia\nPopulation           1567258.0\nLarge Counties            True\nSmall Counties           False\nName: 4, dtype: object\n\n\nOr maybe we want the suburb counties in NJ. In this case, we can pass a list of multiple labels (5, 6, 7)”\n\nnj_suburbs = county_df.loc[ [5, 6, 7] ]\n\nnj_suburbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\nLarge Counties\nSmall Counties\n\n\n\n\n5\nBurlington\n466103.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n6\nCamden\n524907.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n7\nGloucester\n306601.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nNote that this is different than the .iloc[] function, which can also be used to select rows from a DataFrame. However, it uses the integer value of the row, regardless of what the labels in the index are. For example, the first row of a dataframe can always be accessed using:\ndf.iloc[0]\n\nFor more details on the .iloc[] function, see the documentation on indexing by position.\nIn the case of the nj_suburbs dataframe, we can get the first row, which has a label of “5”, using:\n\nnj_suburbs.iloc[0]\n\nCounty Name       Burlington\nPopulation          466103.0\nLarge Counties         False\nSmall Counties          True\nName: 5, dtype: object\n\n\nWe can also reset the index labels so they range from 0 to the length of the dataframe, using the reset_index() function. For example\n\nnj_suburbs_reset = nj_suburbs.reset_index(drop=True)\n\nnj_suburbs_reset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty Name\nPopulation\nLarge Counties\nSmall Counties\n\n\n\n\n0\nBurlington\n466103.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n1\nCamden\n524907.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n2\nGloucester\n306601.0\nFalse\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed more help?\nHow to remember the specifics of all of these functions?\nThe documentation is your best friend: The Pandas user guide\nYou can also use the question mark operator in the notebook!\n\n# Use the question mark\npd.DataFrame.loc?\n\n\nType:        property\nString form: &lt;property object at 0x13712c360&gt;\nDocstring:  \nAccess a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array.\n``.loc[]`` is primarily label based, but may also be used with a\nboolean array.\nAllowed inputs are:\n- A single label, e.g. ``5`` or ``'a'``, (note that ``5`` is\n  interpreted as a *label* of the index, and **never** as an\n  integer position along the index).\n- A list or array of labels, e.g. ``['a', 'b', 'c']``.\n- A slice object with labels, e.g. ``'a':'f'``.\n  .. warning:: Note that contrary to usual python slices, **both** the\n      start and the stop are included\n- A boolean array of the same length as the axis being sliced,\n  e.g. ``[True, False, True]``.\n- An alignable boolean Series.

    "text": "A more interesting example: The Donut Effect\nThe pandemic and growth in work from home led to a phenomenon known as the “Donut Effect”. With more flexible working options and pandemic-driven density fears, people left urban dense cores and opted for more space in city suburbs, driving home and rental prices up in the suburbs relative to city centers.\n\n1. Population change\nI’ve stored more data on population for Philadelphia and its suburbs in a comma-separated value (CSV) file in the data folder: data/phila-metro-counties-population.csv.\nThis data comes from the Census Population Estimates series for counties in the Philadelphia metropolitan region, which includes Philadelphia County, four suburb counties in PA, and 3 suburb counties in NJ. Later in the course, you’ll learn how to download data from the Census directly using Python, but for now, I’ve downloaded and formatted the data already.\nLet’s use this data to see if the donut effect occurred in Philadelphia and its suburbs.\nGoal: Calculate the percent population change from 2020 to 2022 in Philadelphia and the total percent change in the suburb counties and compare!\nFirst, use the pd.read_csv() function from pandas. The first argument to pd.read_csv() is the file path to load.\n\n# Load the data from the CSV file\npop_df = pd.read_csv(\"./data/phila-metro-counties-population.csv\")\n\n\n# How many rows are in the dataframe? --&gt; use the len() operator\nlen(pop_df)\n\n8\n\n\nPeak at the first 5 rows:\n\npop_df.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncounty_name\nstate_name\npop_2020\npop_2022\n\n\n\n\n0\nBucks\nPA\n646112.0\n645054.0\n\n\n1\nChester\nPA\n534783.0\n545823.0\n\n\n2\nDelaware\nPA\n576323.0\n575182.0\n\n\n3\nMontgomery\nPA\n856938.0\n864683.0\n\n\n4\nPhiladelphia\nPA\n1600600.0\n1567258.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Calculate the percent change in population for Philadelphia\nLet’s select the data for Philadelphia to get its population change.\nSteps:\n\nSelect the data for Philadelphia\nSelect the 2020 and 2022 population columns (see the tip below about the squeeze() function)\nCalculate the percent change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: The squeeze() function\n\n\n\nIf we select the data for Philadelphia, it will be DataFrame with only a single row. So if we access a column, it will return a Series of length one, rather than just a number.\nWe can use the .squeeze() function to get rid of this extra dimension of length one. It does just one it sounds like: if you have a DataFrame with only one row, it will “squeeze” the row dimension by removing it, returning just a Series object:\n\n\nThe selector for Philadelphia:\n\npop_df[\"county_name\"] == \"Philadelphia\"\n\n0    False\n1    False\n2    False\n3    False\n4     True\n5    False\n6    False\n7    False\nName: county_name, dtype: bool\n\n\nNow, let’s use the .loc[] function to select the data for Philadelphia\n\nphilly_pop = pop_df.loc[ pop_df['county_name'] == 'Philadelphia' ]\n\nphilly_pop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncounty_name\nstate_name\npop_2020\npop_2022\n\n\n\n\n4\nPhiladelphia\nPA\n1600600.0\n1567258.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphilly_pop = pop_df.loc[pop_df[\"county_name\"] == \"Philadelphia\"].squeeze()\n\nphilly_pop\n\ncounty_name    Philadelphia\nstate_name               PA\npop_2020          1600600.0\npop_2022          1567258.0\nName: 4, dtype: object\n\n\nNow we can calculate the percent change:\n\nphilly_pop_change = 100 * (philly_pop['pop_2022'] / philly_pop['pop_2020'] - 1)\n\nphilly_pop_change\n\n-2.0830938398100685\n\n\nA little more than 2% decline in population from 2020 to 2022!\nA note about string formatting in Python\nWe can format this into a string using an “f-string”, strings that have an “f” before them.\nLook for curly braces in these strings. The syntax is: {variable_name : format string}. For example:\n\nprint(f\"Philadelphia's percent change in population from 2020 to 2022: {philly_pop_change:.1f}%\")\n\nPhiladelphia's percent change in population from 2020 to 2022: -2.1%\n\n\nIn this case, we told Python to format the philly_pop_change as a floating point number with one decimal using .1f.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor more practice with f-strings, see this DataCamp tutorial.\n\n\nNext up: let’s calculate the total population change across all the suburb counties.

If there was a strong “donut effect”, we would expect to see higher price appreciation in the suburbs compared to Philadelphia itself.\nFor this part, we will use Zillow data, specifically data by county for the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) and Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI).\nI’ve already downloaded the data and stored it in the data/ folder.

This usually results in many columns but few rows.\nUsually it’s better to have data in tidy (also known as long) format. Tidy datasets are arranged such that each variable is a column and each observation is a row.\nIn our case, we want to have a column called ZORI and one called ZHVI and a row for each month that the indices were measured.\npandas provides the melt() function for converting from wide formats to tidy formats. melt() doesn’t aggregate or summarize the data. It transforms it into a different shape, but it contains the exact same information as before.\nImagine you have 6 rows of data (each row is a unique county) with 10 columns of home values (each column is a different month). That is wide data and is the format usually seen in spreadsheets or tables in a report.\nIf you melt() that wide data, you would get a table with 60 rows and 3 columns. Each row would contain the county name, the month, and the home value that county and month. This tidy-formatted data contains the same info as the wide data, but in a different form.\nThis animation shows the transformation from wide to long / long to wide. You can ignore gather() and spread() - those are the R versions of the pandas functions.\n\n\npd.melt?\n\n\n\nSignature:\npd.melt(\n    frame: 'DataFrame',\n    id_vars=None,\n    value_vars=None,\n    var_name=None,\n    value_name='value',\n    col_level=None,\n    ignore_index: 'bool' = True,\n) -&gt; 'DataFrame'\nDocstring:\nUnpivot a DataFrame from wide to long format, optionally leaving identifiers set.\nThis function is useful to massage a DataFrame into a format where one\nor more columns are identifier variables (`id_vars`), while all other\ncolumns, considered measured variables (`value_vars`), are \"unpivoted\" to\nthe row axis, leaving just two non-identifier columns, 'variable' and\n'value'.\nParameters\n----------\nid_vars : tuple, list, or ndarray, optional\n    Column(s) to use as identifier variables.\nvalue_vars : tuple, list, or ndarray, optional\n    Column(s) to unpivot.

This object knows what the groups are, but we still need to apply() a function to this object in order to get a DataFrame back!\nLet’s set up our function:\n\ndef calculate_percent_increase(group_df):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the percent increase from 2020-03-31 to 2023-07-31.\n    \n    Note that `group_df` is the DataFrame for each group, in this\n    case, the data for each county.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create selections for the march 2020 and july 2023 data\n    march_sel = group_df[\"Date\"] == \"2020-03-31\"\n    july_sel = group_df[\"Date\"] == \"2023-07-31\"\n    \n    # Get the data for each month (only 1 row, so squeeze it!)\n    march_2020 = group_df.loc[march_sel].squeeze()\n    july_2023 = group_df.loc[july_sel].squeeze()\n\n    # Columns to calculate percent change for\n    columns = [\"ZORI\", \"ZHVI\"]\n    \n    # Return the percent change for both columns\n    return 100 * (july_2023[columns] / march_2020[columns] - 1)\n\nNow, let’s apply this function to our group object:\n\nresult = grouped.apply(calculate_percent_increase)\n\nresult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZORI\nZHVI\n\n\nRegionName\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBucks County\n28.943525\n33.028304\n\n\nBurlington County\n35.053677\n37.403941\n\n\nCamden County\n35.580024\n51.834765\n\n\nChester County\n27.913963\n39.692418\n\n\nDelaware County\n29.269362\n41.453732\n\n\nGloucester County\n36.979221\n44.089155\n\n\nMontgomery County\n27.045037\n39.111692\n\n\nPhiladelphia County\n15.020128\n20.048094\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the index (shown in bold in the notebook output) is the column that we grouped over. That is always the case when we use groupby() in pandas. The resulting DataFrame’s index is the groupby columns.\n\n\nSort by ZHVI and take a look:\n\nresult.sort_values(by=\"ZHVI\", ascending=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZORI\nZHVI\n\n\nRegionName\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia County\n15.020128\n20.048094\n\n\nBucks County\n28.943525\n33.028304\n\n\nBurlington County\n35.053677\n37.403941\n\n\nMontgomery County\n27.045037\n39.111692\n\n\nChester County\n27.913963\n39.692418\n\n\nDelaware County\n29.269362\n41.453732\n\n\nGloucester County\n36.979221\n44.089155\n\n\nCamden County\n35.580024\n51.834765\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaway\nPhiladelphia has had much lower price appreciation for home values and rent values since the pandemic started compared to its suburbs.\nThis is evidence in favor of the “donut effect”, with higher demand in the suburbs driving prices higher!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are a number of built-in, convenience functions that we can use on the groupby object, such as .mean(), .sum(), .size(), etc.\n\n\nFor example, if we wanted to calculate the average ZHVI and ZORI values since March 2020 for every county, we could do the following:\n\n# First trim to dates from March 2020 onwards, then group by county name\ngroup_example = prices_philly_metro.query(\"Date &gt;= '2020-03-31'\").groupby(\"RegionName\")\n\n\n# Select the columns we want, and then use the built-in mean function\navg_prices = group_example[['ZHVI', 'ZORI']].mean()\n\navg_prices.sort_values(\"ZHVI\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZHVI\nZORI\n\n\nRegionName\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhiladelphia County\n208756.603528\n1620.775839\n\n\nCamden County\n255742.478151\n1612.282080\n\n\nGloucester County\n283831.654654\n1868.459836\n\n\nDelaware County\n285825.916694\n1532.245821\n\n\nBurlington County\n315162.461555\n1924.282700\n\n\nMontgomery County\n382385.207204\n1831.782312\n\n\nBucks County\n413498.955059\n1907.576110\n\n\nChester County\n440770.335977\n1880.804478\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Philadelphia also had the lowest average price (about $209k), in addition to the lowest growth in prices, since the pandemic started.\n\n\nBonus: a matplotlib preview\nThe week 2 lectures will dive into (probably too much) detail about matplotlib and data visualization in Python. For now, let’s do a quick and dirty plot for illustration purposes only. The matplotlib details here aren’t important\n\n# The import statement matplotlib\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\nWe’ll plot the ZORI/ZHVI values for each county from March 2020 through July 2023. One way to do this is to use the same groupby operation we used earlier.\nAs shown below, if you iterate over the groupby object, you will get two things back each time:\n\nThe value of the thing you grouped over\nThe dataframe holding the data for that group.\n\nWe will use this trick to group by “RegionName” and when we iterate over the groups, we can easily plot the data for each group on the same axes. It will look like this:\n# Iterate over the data, grouped by county name\nfor countyName, group_df in prices_philly_metro.groupby(\"RegionName\"):\n    \n    # Make our plots, each time using group_df\n    ...\nHere we go…plot the ZORI values.\nTo better see the growth since March 2020, we will normalize the y-axis to 1 in March 2020:\n\n# Create the figure and axes\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Iterate over the data, grouped by county name\nfor countyName, group_df in prices_philly_metro.groupby(\"RegionName\"):\n    \n    # Trim to where Date &gt; March 2020\n    # Sort by Date in ascending order\n    group_df = group_df.sort_values(\"Date\").query(\"Date &gt;= '2020-03-01'\")\n\n    # Date vs. ZORI\n    x = group_df[\"Date\"]\n    y = group_df[\"ZORI\"]\n    \n    # Trime\n    ax.plot(x, y / y.iloc[0], label=countyName)\n\n# Format and add a legend\nax.set_title(\"ZORI Values, Normalized to 1 in March 2020\")\nax.set_xticks([\"2020-03-31\", \"2023-07-31\"])\nax.legend(fontsize=10);\n\n\n\n\nPlot the ZHVI values, normalized to 1 in March 2020:\n\n# Create the figure and axes\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Iterate over the data, grouped by county name\nfor countyName, group_df in prices_philly_metro.groupby(\"RegionName\"):\n    \n    # Trim to where Date &gt; March 2020\n    # Sort by Date in ascending order\n    group_df = group_df.sort_values(\"Date\").query(\"Date &gt;= '2020-03-01'\")\n\n    # Date vs. ZHVI\n    x = group_df[\"Date\"]\n    y = group_df[\"ZHVI\"]\n    \n    # Trime\n    ax.plot(x, y / y.iloc[0], label=countyName)\n\n# Format and add a legend\nax.set_title(\"ZHVI Values, Normalized to 1 in March 2020\")\nax.set_xticks([\"2020-03-31\", \"2023-07-31\"])\nax.legend(fontsize=10);\n\n\n\n\nTakeaway: You can clearly see that price growth in Philadelphia significantly lags the growth in its suburb counties."

Notebook files should be reproducible and executable.\n\nEnsure that your assignments can be executed from top to bottom and produce the desired result. This is how our course TAs will grade each assignment.\nIf your analysis loads a dataset, make sure you either A) Add the dataset to the repository, or B) document the original source of the data so it can be downloaded during grading.\nMake sure you are using relative file paths when loading your data so that the TA can download your repository and the file structure will still work.

Your participation grade will be determined by your activity on Ed Discussion — both asking, answering, and reading questions.\nWhile you are required to submit all six assignments, the assignment with the lowest grade will not count towards your final grade.\nThere’s no penalty for late assignments. I would highly recommend staying caught up on lectures and assignments as much as possible, but if you need to turn something in a few days late, that’s fine — there’s no penalty. If you turn in something late, you’ll be missing out on valuable feedback, but that’s the only practical penalty, there’s no extra penalty to your grade.\n\n\nSoftware\nThis course relies on use of Python and various related packages and for geospatial topics. All software is open-source and freely available. The course will require a working installation of Python on your local computer.

    "section": "Key Concepts",
    "text": "Key Concepts\n\nCommands\nWe’ll be using the mamba tool through its command-line interface rather than a typical graphical user interface (GUI) application. If you are unfamiliar with the command line, this will take some getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it will make working with mamba and Python much easier.\nThe mamba command is the main interface for using the mamba tool for managing your Python packages. From the command line, you simply run:\nconda command [optional arguments will go here]\nwhere “command” is the name of the command you want to run. Commands exist to install new packages, create new environments, and much more.\n\n\nStarting and running mamba\nWe will run mamba from the command line but the specifics of this will depend on your operating system.\n\nWindows\nOpen the Start menu, search for and open the “Miniforge Prompt”. This application provides a command line interface where the mamba tool is properly load, initialized, and ready to be used. Note that you cannot use the default “Command Prompt” application to use mamba because it doesn’t know how to load mamba properly.\nMacOS\nThe Terminal app should be used on MacOS to use mamba. You can also use any Terminal emulator (such as iTerm2). Simply open the Terminal application and the mamba command should be ready to use.\n\n\n\nChannels\n“Channels” are the locations where packages are located. Channels are typically remote and hosted in the cloud. When you specify a channel, mamba will search the remote database for the right package and download it to your local computer.\nBy default, conda usually downloads packages from the defaults channel, which hosts thousands of packages and is managed by the makers of the Anaconda distribution. A full list of packages is available here.\nThe “mambaforge” distribution that we installed in this course is pre-configured to use a community-managed channel known as “conda-forge” instead of the “defaults” channel. Conda forge includes many of the packages on the “defaults” channel but also popular packages that are widely-used but not quite essential enough for the “defaults” channel. A list of maintained packages is available here.\nFor less well known packages, there is a higher likelihood the package will be hosted on conda forge. For that reason, we will prefer downloading and installing packages from conda forge in this course.\n\n\nEnvironments\nThe mamba tool not only lets you download and install packages, but you can group those packages together into environments. By default, the “mambaforge” Python distribution creates an environment named base. We will create a new environment specifically for this course that will hold all of the packages needed for the entire semester.\nEnvironments become particularly useful when working with lots of packages, packages that have a lot of dependencies, or packages that are difficult to install. When environments become too large, it can be difficult to install a new package that satisfies all of the existing package dependencies. For that reason, we will create a fresh, new environment to install the packages we need to use during this course.\n\n\nConda/mamba vs. pip\nThe other widely used method for installing packages is via the pip command. The commands are similar in a lot of ways but with some key differences. The pip command installs packages from the Python Package Index and is designed to install Python-only packages.\nThe main advantage of conda/mamba is that it is cross-platform and can handle dependencies that are written in C (or other languages) and will automatically handle the compiling process during installation. Many of the packages we use in this course have complex dependencies written in C, and mamba will make installation of these packages much easier.\nIn this course, we’ll be using mamba to install packages. Generally speaking, if you already are using mamba to manage environments, it’s best to try to install packages with mamba and if the package is not available, then try using pip.\nSee this article for more information about conda and pip."

    "section": "Common Uses",
    "text": "Common Uses\nManaging environments and installing packages will be done by executing the mamba command in the command line. Below are some of the most common commands that we will use in this class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAll of the examples below should be run in the Terminal app (MacOS) or Miniforge Prompt (Windows). See the Starting and running mamba section above for more detail.\n\n\n\nGetting help with the mamba command\nThe mamba command has a built-in help function. From the command line, run,\nmamba --help\nwhich will print out info about individual commands:\nusage: mamba [-h] [-V] command ...\n\nconda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.\n\nOptions:\n\npositional arguments:\n  command\n    clean             Remove unused packages and caches.\n    compare           Compare packages between conda environments.\n    config            Modify configuration values in .condarc. This is modeled after the git config command. Writes to the user .condarc file\n                      (/Users/nhand/.condarc) by default. Use the --show-sources flag to display all identified configuration locations on your computer.\n    create            Create a new conda environment from a list of specified packages.\n    info              Display information about current conda install.\n    init              Initialize conda for shell interaction.\n    install           Installs a list of packages into a specified conda environment.\n    list              List installed packages in a conda environment.\n    package           Low-level conda package utility. (EXPERIMENTAL)\n    remove (uninstall)\n                      Remove a list of packages from a specified conda environment. Use `--all` flag to remove all packages and the environment itself.\n    rename            Renames an existing environment.\n    run               Run an executable in a conda environment.\n    search            Search for packages and display associated information.The input is a MatchSpec, a query language for conda packages. See examples\n                      below.\n    update (upgrade)  Updates conda packages to the latest compatible version.\n    notices           Retrieves latest channel notifications.\n    repoquery         Query repositories using mamba.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help          Show this help message and exit.\n  -V, --version       Show the conda version number and exit.\nTo find out more info about a specific sub-command, you can run:\nmamba command --help\nFor example, for more info about the arguments (both required and optional) needed to install packages, use: mamba install --help.\n\n\nListing the available environments\nThe default environment when first installing mamba is called 'base'. You can list the currently installed Python environments by running the following command from the command line:\nmamba env list\nThe currently active environment will have a '*' next to it. You should see the 'base' environment as well as any other environments you have created.\n\n\nActivating your environment\nEnvironments must first be “activated” before the packages are available to use. To activate the environment for this course, you can run the following from the command line:\nmamba activate musa-550-fall-2023\nNow, all of the packages in this environment will be available when we run Python.\n\n\nFinding the active environment\nTo see the active environment, list the available environments. The active environment will be listed with a ‘*’ next to its name.\nFrom the command line, run:\nmamba env list\n\n\nListing the installed packages\nIf you have already activated the musa-550-fall-2023 environment, you can list all of the installed packages.\nFrom the command line:\nmamba list\n\n\nActivating the base environment\nTo activate the 'base' default environment, run from the command line:\nmamba activate base\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou should always use the ‘musa-550-fall-2023’ environment to do the analysis in this course. Make sure it is the activated environment when using Python.\n\n\n\n\nDeleting an environment\nNote that you cannot create a new environment with the same name as an existing environment. If your environment becomes corrupted or you run into issues, it is often easiest to delete the environment and start over. To do, you can run the following commands from the command line:\nmamba deactivate\nmamba env remove --name musa-550-fall-2023\n\n\nUpdating an existing environment\nThe environment we are using throughout the course might be need to be updated during the course. For example, we might want to update to include a newly released version of a package.\nYou can update your local environment via the following command. From the command line:\nmamba env update pennmusa/musa-550-fall-2023\nThis command will ensure that the ‘musa-550-fall-2023’ environment on your local computer matches the environment specified by the “environment.yml” file stored in the cloud for the course.\n\n\nInstalling specific packages\nYou shouldn’t need to install any individual packages into the ‘musa-550-fall-2023’ environment. But for reference, you could install specific packages into the active environment using from the command line:\nmamba install package_name"

    "section": "Step 1. Installing Python",
    "text": "Step 1. Installing Python\nThere are a number of different tools and ways to install Python for new users. In this course, we’ll be using a package manager called mamba to install Python and manage dependencies. In the Python ecosystem, package managers are especially useful, as they greatly simplify the installation process and ensure all of your dependencies will function properly.\nmamba is a drop-in replacement (meaning it has the same functionality) for a very popular Python package manager called conda. We’ll use mamba instead of conda because it has signficiantly better performance. In my experience, it’s not uncommon for it to sometimes take more than hour to install a list of Python packages with conda but only a few seconds for mamba to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAnything you can do with the conda tool, you can do with the mamba tool. Outside this class, you’ll likely hear about conda more often, since it’s the more popular tool at the moment.\nAs you will see later, we will often refer to the conda documentation to learn about the key concepts behind conda/mamba and its main functionality.\n\n\nThe mamba tool allows you to easily install Python packages on your laptop using environments. An environment allows you to install packages for specific purposes and keep those packages isolated from any other Python packages that might be installed on your laptop. This is very useful, since different versions of packages often don’t work nicely together. We will create an environment for use during this class that includes all of the Python packages you will need in the course.\nIn this course, we will use the “mambaforge” distribution of Python, which includes Python, mamba, and a few other essential packages and dependencies. It also comes pre-configured with “conda-forge”, a popular, community-maintained server that makes the most popular Python packages available for download for free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe mambaforge distribution is the mamba version of the popular “Miniconda” distribution, which is a free, minimal Python installation that just includes conda. Miniconda is a lightweight version of the full Anaconda distribution. The differences between the “mini” and “full” versions are outlined here.\nThe major difference is that the Anaconda distribution will install more than 1,500 of the most common scientific Python packages (many more than we need in this course) and will take up about 3 GB of disk space. Mambaforge/Miniconda will only install core Python dependencies (as well as mamba/conda) and will only take up a much smaller amount of disk space.\n\n\nThe following page contains the installation files for the mambaforge distribution:\nhttps://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge\nSelect the appropriate file for your computer’s operating system and click to download the file. The file should be named something like Mambaforge-Linux-*, Mambaforge-MacOSX-*, or Mambaforge-Windows-*.\nThe rest of the installation instructions will vary based on your operating system:\n\nWindows\n\nIn the file browser, double-click the .exe file that you downloaded.\nFollow the instructions on the screen. If you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults. You can change them later.\n\nMacOS\n\nOpen the Terminal application.\nChange to the folder to the directory where the .sh installer file was downloaded (this is usually the “Downloads” folder) by running the following command in the Terminal app:\nbash Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh\nor if you have a Mac with the new M2 chips, use:\nbash Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh\nFollow the instructions on the screen. If you are asked about if you “wish the installer to initialize Mambaforge by running conda init?”, type “yes”. This will ensure that mamba is an available command when you open up Terminal.\nIf you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults. You can change them later.\nTo make the changes take effect, close and then re-open your terminal window."

Note that you’ll be using the command line (either the Miniforge Prompt in Windows or Terminal app in MacOS) to run mamba and create your environment.\nThroughout this course, we will maintain an environment called “musa-550-fall-2023” to install and manage all of the packages needed throughout the semester.\nThe packages in an environment are specified in a file typically called “environment.yml”.

The instructions to do so are as follows:\n\nFirst, we need to make sure the anaconda-client package is installed locally. This will ensure that mamba can interface with anaconda.org. From the command line (Miniforge Prompt on Windows or Terminal on MacOS), run:\nmamba install anaconda-client -n base\nThis will install the anaconda-client package into the default “base” environment.\nThen, create the musa-550-fall-2023 environment by running:\nmamba env create pennmusa/musa-550-fall-2023\nAfter this command finishes, all of the packages we need for the course should be installed. To verify this, you can run mamba env list from the command line to see the installed environments.

Notebooks are documents that combine live runnable code with narrative text, images, and interactive visualizations.\nAn application called JupyterLab is the recommended way to work with these notebook files. JupyterLab is a browser-based interface that allows users to execute Python in notebook files. It can also handle all sorts of additional file formats and even has a built-in command-line feature. The JupyterLab guide provides much more information about the features of JupyterLab — for the moment, we will just focus on launching our first notebook file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are other interfaces for working with Jupyter notebooks. The original Jupyter notebook application has since been replaced by the more powerful JupyterLab application. Popular code editors such as VS Code have also added support for Jupyter notebooks, although it is important to note that VS Code does not support all features of notebooks. For this reason, JupyterLab remains the recommended notebook interface.\n\n\nThe recommended approach for starting a notebook is to use the Miniforge Prompt on Windows or the Terminal app on MacOS. To do so, we simply need to activate our 'musa-550-fall-2023' environment and then start JupyterLab, which is included in the course’s environment.\nFrom the command line, first activate the environment:\nmamba activate musa-550-fall-2023\nand then launch JupyterLab\njupyter lab\nThis will create the local Jupyter server and should launch the JupyterLab dashboard in a browser.
