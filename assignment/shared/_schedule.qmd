There are six homework assignments due throughout the semester and one 
final project that is due at the end of the finals period. For grading purposes, 
the assignment with the lowest grade will not count towards your final grade.


## Schedule

The schedule is tentative and could change in the future.

```{r}
input_file <- knitr::current_input(dir = TRUE)
```

```{python, results='asis'}
import sys
from pyprojroot.here import here
from IPython.display import HTML

# Path
path = r.input_file

# Get section number from file path
*_, section_number, _ = path.split('/')

# Add python folder to path
root_dir = here()
sys.path.insert(1, str(root_dir / "python"))
import assignment

# Create the schedule HTML
table = assignment.create_schedule_table(section_number)

print(table)
```
