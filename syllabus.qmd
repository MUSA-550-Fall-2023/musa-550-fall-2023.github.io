Welcome to the course syllabus for MUSA 550, **Geospatial Data Science in
Python**, taught at the University of Pennsylvania in **fall 2023**.

## Overview

This course will provide students with the knowledge and tools to turn data into
meaningful insights, with a focus on real-world case studies in the urban
planning and public policy realm. Focusing on the latest Python software tools,
the course will outline the “pipeline” approach to data science. It will teach
students the tools to gather, visualize, and analyze datasets, providing the
skills to effectively explore large datasets and transform results into
understandable and compelling narratives. The course is organized into five main
sections:

1. **Exploratory Data Science**: Students will be introduced to the main tools
   needed to get started analyzing and visualizing data using Python.
2. **Introduction to Geospatial Data Science**: Building on the previous set of
   tools, this module will teach students how to work with geospatial datasets
   using a range of modern Python toolkits.
3. **Data Ingestion & Big Data**: Students will learn how to collect new data
   through web scraping and APIs, as well as how to work effectively with the
   large datasets often encountered in real-world applications.
4. **From Exploration to Storytelling**: With a solid foundation, students 
   will learn the latest tools to present their analysis results using 
   web-based formats to transform their insights into interactive stories.
1. **Geospatial Data Science in the Wild**: Armed with the necessary data
   science tools, the final module introduces a range of advanced analytic
   and machine learning techniques using a number of innovative examples from
   modern researchers.

### Course Websites

- Main website: [https://musa-550-fall-2023.github.io](https://musa-550-fall-2023.github.io)
- GitHub: [{{< var course.github_org >}}]({{< var course.github_org >}})
- Canvas: [{{< var course.canvas >}}]({{< var course.canvas >}})
- Ed Discussion [https://edstem.org/us/courses/42616/discussion/](https://edstem.org/us/courses/42616/discussion/)

The course's main website will be the main source of information, including
the course schedule, weekly content, and guides/resources.

The course's GitHub page will have repositories for each week's
lectures as well as assignments. Students will also submit their assignments
through GitHub.

We will use Canvas signing up for office hours and tracking grades.

Ed Discussion is a Q&A forum that allows students to ask questions related to 
lecture materials and assignments. 


### Assignments

There are six homework assignments and one required final project at the end 
of the semester. While you are required to submit all six assignments, the
assignment with the lowest grade will not count towards your final grade.

For the final project, students will replicate the pipeline approach on a
dataset (or datasets) of their choosing. Students will be required to use
several of the analysis techniques taught in the class and produce a web-based
data visualization that effectively communicates the empirical results to a
non-technical audience. The final product should also include a description of
the methods used in each step of the data science process (collection, analysis,
and visualization).

For more details on the final project, see [the GitHub
repository]({{< var course.github_org >}}/final-project).

### Grading

The grading breakdown is as follows: 55% for homework; 45% for final project,
5% for participation. Your participation grade will be determined
by your activity on Ed Discussion — both asking, answering, and reading
questions.

While you are required to submit all six assignments, the
assignment with the lowest grade will not count towards your final grade.

There’s no penalty for late assignments. I would **highly recommend** staying 
caught up on lectures and assignments as much as possible, but if 
you need to turn something in a few days late, that’s fine — there’s no penalty. 
If you turn in something late, you'll be missing out on valuable feedback, 
but that's the only practical penalty, there’s no extra penalty to your grade.

### Software

This course relies on use of Python and various related packages and for
geospatial topics. All software is open-source and freely available. The course
will require a working installation of Python on your local computer. See the
[Installation Setup Guide](/resources/install) for
instructions on how to setup your computer for use in this course.

## Policies

{{< var course.number >}} is a fast-paced course that covers a lot of topics in 
a short amount of time. I know that it can be overwhelming and frustrating, 
particularly as you are trying to learn Python syntax and the topics
in the course at the same time. But I firmly believe that all students can 
succeed in this class.

You'll get the most out of the course if you stay up to date on the lectures 
and assignments. If you fall behind, I know there can be a desire to copy code 
from the Internet or others to help you complete assignments. Ultimately, this 
will be detrimental to your progress as an analytics wizard. My goal for this 
course is for everyone to learn and engage with the material to the best of 
their ability. 

::: {callout-important}
If you find yourself falling behind or struggling with Python issues, please 
ask for help by:

1. Post a question on Canvas — the fix for your problem might be quick and other students are probably experiencing similar issues.
1. Come to office hours and discuss issues or larger conceptual questions you are having.
1. Take advantage of the [free resources](./resource/python.qmd) to help fine-tune your Python skills. 
:::

And if you are still struggling, reach out and let me know and we'll figure out a strategy to make things work!

### Communication Policies

- Please add the following text into the subject line of emails to us:
  [MUSA550]. This will help us make sure we don't miss your email!
- We will use the Ed Discussion Q&A forum for questions related to lecture material and assignments.
- To prevent code copying, please do not post long, complete code examples to Ed Discussion.
- Anonymous posting is enabled on Ed Discussion — if you have a question that requires
  a full code example, please use the anonymous feature to post the question.
- We will also use Ed Discussion for announcements — please make sure your
  notifications are turned on and you check the website frequently. This will
  be the primary method of communication for course-wide announcements.
- If you have larger-scale or conceptual questions on assignments or lecture
  material, please set up a time to discuss during office hours.

### Group Work

Students are allowed (and encouraged!) to collaborate when working through
lecture materials or assignments. If you work closely with other students,
please list the members of your group at the top of your assignment.

### Special Accommodations

There are a number of ongoing situations in the world that may take precedence
over the course work. If you are experiencing any difficulties outside the
course, please [contact me](mailto:nhand@design.upenn.edu) and accommodations can be made.
Similarly, if you are having any difficulties with the course schedule,
attending lectures, or similar, please let us know.

### Academic Integrity

Students are expected to be familiar with and comply with Penn’s Code of
Academic Integrity, which is available in the Pennbook, or online at
[https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity).
