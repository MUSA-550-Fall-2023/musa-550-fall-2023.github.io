### Python tutorials & DataCamp access

A number of Python resources are listed on [the course website](https://musa-550-fall-2023.github.io/resource/python.html). In particular, 
DataCamp is providing 6 months of complimentary access to its courses for students in MUSA 550. Whether you have experience with Python or not, this is a great opportunity to learn the basics of Python and practice your skills.

It is strongly recommended that you watch some or all of the introductory videos below to build a stronger Python foundation for the semester. The more advanced, intermediate courses are also great â€” the more the merrier!
